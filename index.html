    <p>I love most sports, but especially basketball and volleyball. I also love music, movies and playing games!</p>
    <p>My major is computer science, my brother recently started working for UPS, and coding for them.</p>
    <p>I would like to work with him, because he is the one who got me interested in coding in the first place.</p>
