                Purpose: On this page will be a brief history of the rock era in music, where the inspiration came from that started rock music, which
                bands pioneered it, and which bands rose to fame with it. The site will have drop down boxes of different bands during this era, with images of these bands,
                and descriptions of these bands as well. These descriptions will contain the members of the band, and some of their hits, as more descriptions will be on
                the specific pages that will be for specific bands.

              <p>
                Actions: On the homepage, anyone will be able to sign up for a newsletter, and in this newsletter, each week there will be a focus on a specific band,
                and their music, or a specific subgenre of rock, and some bands that are popular in that genre. It will need to collect the users first and last name, their
                email address, and an optional phone number for the users account.
                
              </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
              <p>
                Why This Page: This site will be completely dedicated to the rock genre of music, and will feature many bands instead of being a bands personal site, or only a wikipedia page
                about music. It will be more cosmetically pleasing than a wikipedia page, and not biased to try and sell tickets or music from specific band.
