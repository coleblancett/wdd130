      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose: On this page will be a brief history of the rock era in music, where the inspiration came from that started rock music, which
        bands pioneered it, and which bands rose to fame with it. The site will have drop down boxes of different bands during this era, with images of these bands,
        and descriptions of these bands as well. These descriptions will contain the members of the band, and some of their hits, as more descriptions will be on
        the specific pages that will be for specific bands.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions: On the homepage, anyone will be able to sign up for a newsletter, and in this newsletter, each week there will be a focus on a specific band,
        and their music, or a specific subgenre of rock, and some bands that are popular in that genre. It will need to collect the users first and last name, their
        email address, and an optional phone number for the users account.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Why This Page: This site will be completely dedicated to the rock genre of music, and will feature many bands instead of being a bands personal site, or only a wikipedia page
        about music. It will be more cosmetically pleasing than a wikipedia page, and not biased to try and sell tickets or music from specific band.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Queen</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose: The purpose of this page will be to focus on the band Queen, one of the most popular bands of the age of rock. There will be much more description of this band,
        as well as their background, the background of each member, and their inspiration. 

      </p>
      <p>
        Actions: There will be links to some hit songs from this band, as well as links to interviews so the user can learn more about specific artists who made rock what it
        is today. This page will not be made necessarily to promote individual bands themselves, but to promote the user into learning more about music and it's history, and
        just how diverse and how many genres and artists make up music as we know it.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Beatles</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose: The purpose of this page will be to focus on the band The Bealtes, another one of the most popular bands of the age of rock. The description here will be much
        more descriptive than it would be on the homepage, as this connecting site is able to more focus on the band itself and how they came to be, and what inspired them, 
        rather than only focusing on how they contributed to the rock era.

      </p>
      <p>
        Actions: There will be links to some hit songs from this band, as well as links to interviews so the user can learn more about specific artists who made rock what it
