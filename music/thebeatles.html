            Purpose: The purpose of this page will be to focus on the band The Bealtes, another one of the most popular bands of the age of rock. The description here will be much
            more descriptive than it would be on the homepage, as this connecting site is able to more focus on the band itself and how they came to be, and what inspired them, 
            rather than only focusing on how they contributed to the rock era.

            Actions: There will be links to some hit songs from this band, as well as links to interviews so the user can learn more about specific artists who made rock what it
            is today. This page will not be made necessarily to promote individual bands themselves, but to promote the user into learning more about music and it's history, and
            just how diverse and how many genres and artists make up music as we know it.
